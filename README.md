# JumboCode Vite Template

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with
- TypeScript
- ESLint
- TailwindCSS
- Wouter
- Vercel Serverless Functions

To get the template up and running:
1. Create a Vercel account (or use an existing one) for this project
2. If not already installed, install the LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli).
3. Clone/fork/download the repository.
4. Install all required packages by running `npm install` in the root folder of the repository.
5. Run the development server (both frontend and backend) with `vercel dev`. You may need to do some project setup on Vercel when running this command for the first time. Follow the CLI prompts.
